## Project Name
Defi Chat

### Project Description
Defi chat is an exchange of token to token and token to fiat, and the approach is that we are using a chat base platform where user can use a natural language to make their swap and interact. It is basically leveraging the gemini api to also allow users that does not want to click but just want to chat to make their transactions, this is just like a prototype of our chat bot on Whatsapp. The conversion to fiat leverage Ekubo oracle and on-chain price oracle infrastructure built as an extension to the Ekubo AMM protocol, enabling robust and manipulation-resistant price feeds for DeFi applications. The smart contract is built with cairo and frontend built with NextJs.
