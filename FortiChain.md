# What is FortiChain

FortiChain is revolutionizing blockchain security by creating a trustless ecosystem for vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty management. FortiChain is just like a smart contract quality checker.



## How to use

FortiChain is focused on creating friendly user interfaces for all users. This is the user flow of  FortiChain


- **Organization / Project Owner X** comes to FortiChain and signs up using either Braavos or argent wallet. Register a project and grant FortiChain access to the codebase or code snap to be audited. Fund the escrow or also called FortiChain mini bank for the project and select the deadline for the audit to be completed. If due to unforeseen circumstances the deadline elapses, The project owner can either extend the deadline or withdraw their funds or add more funds to  the escrow. The project owner cannot close a project if the deadline has not elapsed.

- **Researcher Y**  comes to FortiChain and signs up using either Braavos or argent, Search for projects that need to be audited or review open bounties. The researcher will then create a report about their findings and submit it on the platform with various materials that support their auditing.


- **Validator Z** comes to FortiChain and signs up using either  Braavos or Argent, fills their profile details and requirements to be a validator which will be approved by the admin of FortiChain before they will  be able to validate the report submitted by the researcher. Once the Validator approves the report. The smart contract executes and  funds are transferred to the researcher and validator wallet from the escrow. The validator can request for more audit information from the researcher or reject the report.


# Problem Statement

The blockchain ecosystem faces a critical security challenge, despite the immutable and transparent nature of the technology, the discovery, reporting, and remediation of smart contract vulnerabilities remain largely centralized, opaque, and inefficient. This fundamental contradiction undermines the security of billions of dollars in digital assets.


## Current Challenges:

- Centralized Vulnerability Management: Most bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure programs rely on centralized platforms that serve as intermediaries between developers and security researchers, where in some cases security researchers are not being paid by the centralized authority.


- Trust Issues: Security researchers often hesitate to disclose vulnerabilities due to concerns about recognition, fair compensation, and potential disputes.


- Inefficient Resolution Processes: Manual review and verification processes delay critical security fixes, leaving assets at risk for extended periods, which can lead to severe damages.


- Limited Transparency: The current vulnerability disclosure ecosystem lacks the transparency needed to build trust among all stakeholders, developers and security researchers.


# Historical Impact of Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

The blockchain industry has repeatedly suffered catastrophic losses due to smart contract vulnerabilities in the past which led to digital assets owners going bankrupt:

- The DAO Hack (2016): $60 million in ETH stolen due to a reentrancy vulnerability, leading to an Ethereum hard fork.


- Poly Network Exploit (2021): $610 million stolen across multiple chains due to a contract vulnerability that allowed attackers to become contract owners.


- Wormhole Bridge Hack (2022): $320 million stolen due to a vulnerability in signature verification.


- Ronin Bridge Hack (2022): $625 million stolen due to compromised private keys and insufficient security controls.


- Nomad Bridge Exploit (2022): $190 million drained due to a misconfiguration in contract initialization.


- Mango Markets Manipulation (2022): $114 million exploited through price manipulation in lending protocols.


These incidents demonstrate the urgent need for a robust, decentralized security infrastructure that can identify vulnerabilities before they're exploited and that is where FortiChain comes in.

## FortiChain Solution
FortiChain addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized platform for vulnerability disclosure , reporting  and bug bounty management built on blockchain technology. 

FortiChain will be implementing the following features for Version one ( V1 ) which  include:

- Trustless Vulnerability Reporting: Security researchers can submit reports with confidence that their contributions will be fairly evaluated and rewarded if accepted by the validator.

- Automated Bounty Management: Smart contracts handle bounty escrow and distribution, eliminating payment disputes and delay .


- Decentralized Verification: A community of validators reviews submissions, ensuring fair and transparent evaluations of reports submitted by security researchers.


- Complete Transparency: All activities are recorded on-chain, creating an immutable audit trail and escrow payment.

FortiChain will not just stop there, FortiChain will be integrating the follow features for version 2

- AI agent for faster bug detection and reporting
- Reputation System
- Validator Staking Economics
- Token Utility:

## Project Category

FortiChain is an Infrastructure built mainly for smart contract security.



## Why I’m Building This
As someone deeply passionate about both blockchain technology and security, I’m building FortiChain because I believe that a decentralized future must also be a secure one. Today’s reliance on centralized audits and informal bug bounty programs introduces risks that are incompatible with the principles of Web3.

By creating a platform that formalizes, decentralizes, and automates the vulnerability lifecycle, I want to empower communities to take ownership of their project security — and give researchers and validators the tools they need to be valued contributors in a trustless ecosystem.
