### Project Name
Zkraft by Henry

### Project Description
Zkraft is an on-chain smart contract platform that allows Cairo developers to post their code, describe bugs or improvement needs, and attach STRK bounties to attract solutions. Contributors submit fixes or enhancements, and once a solution is accepted by the project owner, the bounty is automatically released on-chain. This creates a trustless, transparent way to get help with real smart contract problems — from debugging to optimization — powered entirely by the StarkNet ecosystem.
